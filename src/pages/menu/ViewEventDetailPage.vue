      – On the occasion of its 8th anniversary, the Institute of Banking and
      Finance (IBF) Cambodia takes a moment to reflect on its journey and
      accomplishments over the past eight years. The institute has played a
      pivotal role in bridging the gap between academia and the banking
      industry, and in nurturing the next generation of financial professionals
      in Cambodia. Founded in 2016, IBF has since provided skill trainings and
      certifications to over 50,000 professionals at all levels in the banking
      and finance sector in Cambodia. The main focus of its programs centers
      around the core components of the banking and financial institutions
      (BFIs), aiming to strengthen corporate governance and to standardize and
      uplift local and international best practices. Today, IBF proudly signed a
      Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Center for Banking Studies
      (CBS) of the National Bank of Cambodia. This significant event, held at
      the CBS premises, also marks the 8th anniversary of IBF, celebrating its
      eight-year-long commitment to enhancing the banking and finance sector in
      Cambodia. Mr. Michel DABADIE, Co-Director of CBS, expressed his enthusiasm
      for the MoU, highlighting the future mutual benefits for the students and
      for the whole Cambodian banking system. Meanwhile, Mr. SOU Visal, CEO of
      IBF, stated that the collaboration between IBF and CBS will significantly
      create a rubust academic framework that will shape the future leaders of
      the banking industry by equiping them with a comprehensive understanding
      of the complexities of the financial world. The MoU signing ceremony was
      graced by distinguished guests, including H.E Kith Sovannarith, Director
      General of Banking Supervision, Mr. Rath Sophoan, Chairman of ABC
      Councils, IBF Board of Directors, and management of CBS. The partnership
      aims to bolster collaboration between IBF and CBS, with a focus on
      developing industry standards and enhancing educational programs in the
      financial sector. This meaningful collaboration is expected to benefit not
      only students and the financial sector but also contribute to fostering a
      skilled workforce capable of driving economic growth.
